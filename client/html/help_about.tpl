<p>WildPa.ws is an image board specializing in feral furries, inspired by services
such as Danbooru, Gelbooru, and Moebooru. We currently are testing this on the
Szurubooru image board engine. Its name <a href='http://sjp.pwn.pl/sjp/;2527372'>has
its roots in Polish language and has onomatopeic meaning of scraping or
scrubbing</a>. It is pronounced as <em>shoorubooru</em>.</p>
